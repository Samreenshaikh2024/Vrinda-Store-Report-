# Vrinda-Store-Report-
I am delighted to present my inaugural immersive exploration of Vrinda Stores' Sales Report data via an interactive Excel dashboard. This project involved analyzing Vrinda Store Data for the year 2022, sourced from the Rishabh Mishra YouTube channel. The objective was to provide the store with insights, including trend analysis of sales and customer behavior, to facilitate strategic decision-making for increased sales in 2023.
Below are the problem statements addressed in my recent project:
. Comparative analysis of sales and orders in 2022 for Vrinda Store.
. Identification of the month with the highest sales and orders.
. Analysis of product purchases by gender (men vs. women).
. Compilation of different order statuses observed in 2022.
. Determination of the top 5 states contributing to maximum sales.
. Exploration of the relationship between age, gender, and number of orders.
. Evaluation of the sales contribution from various channels.
Throughout the project, I applied techniques such as data cleaning, processing, analysis, visualization, and report creation. Special thanks to Rishabh Mishra for his valuable guidance during this endeavor.
